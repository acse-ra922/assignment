## Installation

I have created my own environment in the environment.yml file, to install this environment in your computer, run
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To install the module and any pre-requisites, from the base directory run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```  

The module assignment_solution contains a python file dist_function.py.
The function distance solves the problem mentioned in the assignment.
In addition to distance function, there is a main function and a complexity analysis function.

Moreover, the folder tests contain a python file tests.py which uses pytest to test the distance function.
I have created a github workflow to run pytest.
