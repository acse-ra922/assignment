## Installation

I have created my own environment in the environment.yml file, to install this environment in your computer, run
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To install the module and any pre-requisites, from the base directory run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```  

The module assignment_solution contains a python file dist_function.py.
The function distance solves the problem mentioned in the assignment.
In addition to distance function, there is a main function and a complexity analysis function.

Moreover, the folder tests contain a python file tests.py which uses pytest to test the distance function.



## Documentation

The documentation for this assignment is included in the docs folder in the documentation.pdf file.
This pdf file was auto-generated by sphinx.

## Testing

I have performed unit-testing on the code using pytest. The tests folder contains a test.py file which has five different test cases
to check the accuracy of the code.

In addition to this I have saved the results of the pytest file in the output.log file in the tests folder.
